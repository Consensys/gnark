Thanks to ivokub for providing the source code. I made some modifications to make it runs better. This example simulates the prover and verifier interactions in a real-world scenario. To run the file, you simply goes to the prover folder and use command go run prover.go. This will generate two files, a proof file and a verification key file. Now copy and paste those two files to the verifier folder, then use command go run verifier.go to verify the proof.
