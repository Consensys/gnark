# Known `gnark` users

* [Linea](https://linea.build) - Ethereum L2 rollup based on ZKPs. gnark is used for precompile proving, Vortex proof recursive verification, 2-chain proof aggregation, proof compression to BN254 and PLONK Solidity verification. gnark-crypto is used for finite field arithmetic.
* [DAVINCI](https://davinci.vote) - Specialized L2 rollup based on ZKPs for voting. A decentralized, anonymous and receipt-free voting protocol designed and implemented by the [Vocdoni](https://vocdoni.io) team. Uses Proof recursion and settles to Ethereum.
* [Union](https://union.build) - Modular interoperability protocol which facilitates the exchange of messages between blockchains. Gnark is used to prove consensus.
* [Reclaim protocol](https://reclaimprotocol.org/) - Migrated circuits from snarkjs to gnark for mobile-proof generation efficiency; open‑sourced their symmetric‑crypto circuits.
* [AlgoPlonk](https://github.com/giuliop/AlgoPlonk) - Go toolkit that turns any gnark-defined PLONK circuit into an Algorand smart contract verifier.
* [Celer Network](https://celer.network/) – Leveraging gnark for zero-knowledge proof generation within cross-chain messaging and state verification mechanisms.
* [zkBank](https://github.com/zksecurity/zkBank) – Capture-the-flag style ZK banking system built by the zkSecurity team. Uses gnark to implement and verify GKR-based zero‑knowledge proofs in Go.
