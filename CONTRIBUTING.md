## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
#### Before Submitting A Bug 
* Ensure the bug is not already reported by searching on GitHub under 
[Issues](https://github.com/consensys/gnark/issues).
#### How Do I Submit a (Good) Bug?
* If you are unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a 
**title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or 
an **executable test case** demonstrating the unexpected behavior.
* Describe the **exact steps** to **reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When 
listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it. For example, the exact 
commands used in the terminal to start `gnark`. 
* Provide **specific examples** to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or 
copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, 
use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/).
* Describe the **behavior you observed** after following the steps and explain the 
problem with that behavior.
* Explain the **behavior you expected** instead and why.
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem 
happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

### Suggesting Enhancements
#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion
* [Search](https://github.com/consensys/gnark/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been 
suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?
Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. Create an issue on and provide 
the following information:

* Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* Provide a **step-by-step description** of the suggested enhancement in as much detail as possible.
* Describe the **current behavior** and explain the **behavior you expect** instead and why.
* Explain why this enhancement would be useful to other users.
* Specify the **name and version of the OS** you're using.
* Specify the **name and version of any relevant packages**.

### Pull Requests
There are a number of automated checks:
* `go fmt`
* `go vet`

If these checks pass, pull requests will be reviewed by the project team against criteria including:
* purpose - is this change useful
* test coverage - are there unit/integration/acceptance tests demonstrating the change is effective
* code consistency - naming, comments, design
* changes that are solely formatting are likely to be rejected

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but 
bigger changes should contain more detail.
