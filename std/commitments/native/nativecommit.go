// Package native implements native commitment extension.
//
// If the builder implements [frontend.Committer] interface, then we can commit
// to the variables and get a commitment which can be used as a unique
// randomness in the circuit. For current builders implementing this interface,
// the function can only be called once in a circuit. This makes it difficult to
// compose different gadgets which require randomness.
//
// This package extends the commitment interface by allowing to receive several
// functions unique commitment multiple times. It does this by collecting all
// variables to commit and the callbacks which want to access a commitment. Then
// we internally defer a function which computes the commitment over all input
// committed variables and then uses this commitment to derive a per-callback
// unique commitment. The callbacks are then called with these unique derived
// commitments instead.
