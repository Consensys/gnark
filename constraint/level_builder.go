package constraint

// The main idea here is to find a naive clustering of independent constraints that can be solved in parallel.
//
// We know that at each constraint, we will have at most one unsolved wire.
// (a constraint may have no unsolved wire in which case it is a plain check that the constraint hold,
// or it may additionally have some wires that will be solved by solver hints)
//
// We build a graph of dependency; we say that a wire is solved at a level l
// --> l = max(level_of_dependencies(wire)) + 1
