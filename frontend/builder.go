// NewBuilder is a function that creates a new constraint system builder for a
// given field. It takes a field modulus and a CompileConfig as arguments and
// returns a Builder interface and an error. The Builder interface provides
// methods for building and compiling the constraint system.

// gnark currently implements two builder constructors:
//   - r1cs.NewBuilder
//   - plonk.NewBuilder.
//
// For a constructor optimized for small field modulus, use [NewBuilderU32] instead.

// functionality. However, the wrapped builders should not overwrite methods in
// [Builder] and embedded interfaces as it may lead to unexpected behavior.
